# songs

Topic - Songs list, restaurants, video games, books, tweets, etc.. (Anything that is searchable really)
Requirements
Use any JS framework (Vue, React, Angular, etc...), and CSS framework (Bootstrap, Tailwind, Foundation) of your choice - or even something like: https://www.vue-tailwind.com/
Use a simple JSON as your data source, 10-15 items (or you can use a real API if you really want to, any public API like Twitter or GitHub, whatever)
A simple UI to search for titles, description
Filters result by Year, Publisher, Genre.
Users should be able to click and view additional detail of the item of the results
Mobile responsive
When you are done, submit your GitHub repo to mon@epcarbon.com - either make it private, invite me as a collaborator; or a public repo but don’t put anything like “EP Carbon” in your repo so it’s not accidentally given away the code challenge to other potential candidates
Bonus: minify the codes/assets
Deadline: Within a week of receiving this email
